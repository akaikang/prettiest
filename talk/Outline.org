* Intro

- Pretty printing (and typesetting in general) is hard!

- cahotic: if you change something towards the beginning it may have
  non-linear effects way down the document

- critically sensitive to small changes: every saved line counts

* Running Example: SExpr
Assume that an s-expr can be pretty-printed either horizontally or
vertically:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(a b c d)
#+END_EXAMPLE
or

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(a
 b
 c
 d)
#+END_EXAMPLE
Recall
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data SExpr = SExpr [SExpr] | Atom String

#+END_SRC

         (a b c d)
         (a b c d)))

             d)
            (a
             b
             c
             d)
            (a
             b
             c
             d)
            (a
             b
             c
             d))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* State of the pop-art: Wadler

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
12345678901234567890

((abcde
  ((a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)))
 (abcdefgh
  ((a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d))))
#+END_EXAMPLE
- will waste a line here and there
- lack of "hang" feature

* I am not satisfied
What I want:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
((abcde ((a b c d)
         (a b c d)
         (a b c d)
         (a b c d)
         (a b c d)))
 (abcdefgh
  ((a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d)
   (a b c d))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Laws of Pretty-Printing (paraphrased)

In general, this is what I want:

1. A pretty-printer shall not print beyond the right margin
2. A pretty-printer shall reveal the structure of the input
3. A pretty-printer shall use as few lines as possible

   - Hughes breaks 3
   - Wadler breaks 2 (cannot specify "to the right of" in general)
   - I am trading performance for abiding to the laws.
     (Greedy cannot be pretty.)

* What does rule 2 really mean?

- Recall rule 2: "A pretty-printer shall reveal the structure of the
  input"

- The user must specify a mapping from input to
  layout which reveals the structure

- The API to describe pretty layouts:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Layout l where
  text    :: String -> l
  (<>)    :: l -> l -> l
  flush   :: l -> l
  (<|>)   :: l -> l -> l
#+END_SRC

* Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
pretty :: Doc d => SExpr -> d
pretty  (Atom s)    = text "(" <>
                      (sep $ map pretty xs) <>
                      text ")"

sep :: Doc d => [d] -> d
sep []  = empty
sep xs  = hsep xs <|> vcat xs

hsep,vcat :: Doc d => [d] -> d
vcat  = foldDoc ($$)
hsep  = foldDoc (<+>)

foldDoc :: Doc d => (d -> d -> d) -> [d] -> d
foldDoc _ []      = empty
foldDoc _ [x]     = x
foldDoc f (x:xs)  = f x (foldDoc f xs)
#+END_SRC

* Semantics (1a): Roughly following Hughes'
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
type L = [String] -- non empty.

instance Layout L where
  render :: L -> String
  render = intercalate "\n"
  text :: String -> L
  text s = [s]
  (<>) :: L -> L -> L
  xs <> (y:ys) = xs0 ++ [x ++ y] ++ map (indent ++) ys
     where  xs0 = init xs
            x :: String
            x = last xs
            n = length x
            indent = replicate n ' '
  flush :: L -> L
  flush xs = xs ++ [""]

xs $$ ys = flush xs <> ys
#+END_SRC

* Semantics (1b): Horizontal composition

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
      yyyyyyyyyy
      yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
      yyyyyyyyy
#+END_EXAMPLE


* Semantics (2): Disjunction

By idiomatic distribution oversets

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
instance Layout [L] where
  text = pure . text
  flush = fmap flush
  xs <> ys = (<>) <$> xs <*> ys
  xs <|> ys = (xs ++ ys)
#+END_SRC

- The above is an executable specification.

- It has unacceptable performance: every choice induces two layouts.
  Printing any document with >20 disjunctions is unrealistic.

* Making it fast (1b): consider the useful parts only

The choice of layout depends only on 3 parameters: width, height the
width of the last line.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
             width
         <---------------->
         xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ^
         xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx |  height
         xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx v
         xxxxxxx
         <----->
        last width
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Making it fast (1b): consider the useful parts only
#+NAME: fig:cat
#+CAPTION: Concatenation
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[file:HCat.png]]

* Making it fast (2): discard dominated results

/a/ dominates /b/ iff. /a/ is smaller than /b/ in all three dimensions

If /a/ dominates /b/, then for any context /ctx/,

   /ctx a/  dominates  /ctx b/

So, at any point we can discard all dominated layouts from the set of
possible layouts.

* Conclusion

- We have defined pretty printing (3 principes)
- They are not compatible with a greedy approach
- But we can still make a fast printer
- And even write it in pearl style!

- This is an attempt to do a more realistic FP pearl: bridge the gap
  between what actually goes on in programming (informal spec,
  graphical models, worry about difficult parts only) and program
  calculation style found in classical pearls

- In the paper: all reasoning steps and lovely typesetting.
