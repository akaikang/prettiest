I have addressed the mandatory revisions as follows:

1. I have changed the citation style as requested.

2. I have extended the systematic testing to random s-expressions
   (sec. 7.1) and added a plot with the results.

3. I have tested the pretty printing algorithm without domination
   pruning. In this situation it behaves exponentially, preventing to
   test on any non-trivial input. This is reported at the end of
   sec. 7.1.

4. I have performed a new series of tests which exercises the pretty
   printer in typical conditions (sec 7.2). To do so I've pretty
   printed several typical XML and JSON inputs. In this series of
   tests I've measured the rendering time (not just the runtime of the
   layout algorithm). I have also run the test with Wadler-Leijen and
   Hughes-Peyton Jones libraries.
